            <h2>Why I got into Tech?</h2>
            <p>I think the thing I love most about technology 
                is how it has provided me an outlet to express 
                myself creatively through the ideas I think of 
                and build. I think in today's day and age 
                technology is what makes the world go around. 
                I love to solve problems and use my creativity 
                and this passion for technology has been the 
                driving force for my continued learning in the 
                field. </p>

            <h2>How I have been learning?</h2>
            <p>Since I graduated from Brunel University with a Bachelor's in
                 Computer Science, I've actually spent some time playing 
                 professional basketball, but that hasn't slowed down my 
                 passion for tech. During this time, I taught myself how to 
                 build websites and have started my own freelance side hustle 
                 (<span><a href="https://acquahxweb.com/">acquahxweb.com</a></span>).
                 Investing time and money into resources such as Leetcode, CodeAcademy, Mimo,
                 freeCodeCamp has been great for my growth and these platforms have 
                 become my best friends over the years. My real life friends who work
                 in tech have also been of great assistance to me. I feel as though
                 a supportive team around you is always important while learning too.
                 I was also blessed enough to take part in a Coding Skills Bootcamp 
                 at the end of last year provided by Rubik Talent and receive a 
                 certificate for this. This has furthered my desire to deepen my
                 understanding of software development. Expanding my knowledge
                 of JavaScript and Frameworks like React has allowed me to explore
                 my creativity through personal projects I have built on my GitHub.</p>

            <h2>My Goal</h2>
            <p>  My ultimate goal is to one day become a senior developer
                 and eventually use my skills to set up a tech academy 
                 in my parents home country on Ghana. Technology has 
                 shaped my life and provided me with so many opportunities 
                 to learn and better myself. I would like it to do the 
                 same for people where access to certain resources is 
                 not so common. </p>
